  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Ber. He.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.  
  Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Ber. It would be spoke to.
  Ber. Last night of all,
  Ber. Long live the King!
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Bernardo, officer.
  Ber. Say-
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Ber. Well, good night.
  Ber. Who's there.?

  Both. Arm'd, my lord.
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.  
  Both. Longer, longer.
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Both. My lord, from head to foot.
  Both. My lord, we will not.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice  
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,

    But I have that within which passeth show-
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    But let me hear from you.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,

    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
    But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips

    But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    But this eternal blazon must not be

    But to my mind, though I am native here  
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
    But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,

    But what is your affair in Elsinore?

    By indirections find directions out.
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
by William Shakespeare
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,

  Claudius, King of Denmark.
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,

    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.

    Contagious blastments are most imminent.

  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,  
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;  
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent  
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.

  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
  Hor. That can I.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Hor. 'Tis here!
  Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
  Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
  Hor. What news, my lord?
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!
    How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    I have sworn't.
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
    I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    I'll visit you.
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    In filial obligation for some term
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    In honourable fashion.
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    In the dead vast and middle of the night
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.

    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    I shall not look upon his like again.
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    I stay too long. But here my father comes.
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'  
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
    It waves you to a more removed ground.
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
    I would know that.
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth

  King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
  Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
  Laer. My dread lord,
  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
  Laer. O, fear me not!
  Laertes, son to Polonius.
  Laer. Think it no more.

    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,

  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!

  Mar. Look with what courteous action
  Mar. Lord Hamlet!
  Mar. My good lord!
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
  Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
  Mar. No, it is struck.

  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
  Mar. O, wonderful!
  Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.

    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,

    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    So oft it chances in particular men
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust

    Such was the very armour he had on
    Swear.

    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.

    Than that which dearest father bears his son

    Than your particular demands will touch it.

    That he is open to incontinency.
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven

    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;

    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
    That youth and observation copied there,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.

    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    The form of plausive manners, that these men
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    The head is not more native to the heart,

    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    This present object made probation.
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us

    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,

    Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Who hath reliev'd you?
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Who is't that can inform me?
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    With all my imperfections on my head.
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd  
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    With which she followed my poor father's body
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;  
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    Yes, faith, heartily.
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone  
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.

    Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
  Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.  
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    With all my imperfections on my head.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed  
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  Ham. Pale or red?
    When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!

    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
    But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd  
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    To what I shall unfold.
    An understanding simple and unschool'd;
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
  Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and  
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And each particular hair to stand an end
  Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
    And carriage of the article design'd,

    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    It waves you to a more removed ground.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
  Ham. O God!
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    Never to speak of this that you have heard:
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,

    A sable silver'd.

  Both. Arm'd, my lord.

  Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!
  Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
  Hor. O, where, my lord?
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.

  Rey. I will, my lord.
    What does this mean, my lord?
  Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.  
  Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.

  Hor. Do not, my lord!
  Rey. Ay, my lord,

  Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.

    And lay your hands again upon my sword.
    Swear by my sword.
    Swear by my sword.
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd

    Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,

Dramatis Personae

    A double blessing is a double grace;
    Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
    So, by my former lecture and advice,
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice  
    There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    To offer it the show of violence;
    Nor shall you do my ear that violence
    Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
    He closes with you in this consequence:
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    And recks not his own rede.
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
    And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
    Why seems it so particular with thee?
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
    Go on. I'll follow thee.
    I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
  Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    And prey on garbage.
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
                 Ghost cries under the stage.
    The triumph of his pledge.
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    'Tis strange.
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
    May sweep to my revenge.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
  Ber. He.
    Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
    Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
    With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
    These hands are not more like.
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
  Hor. Nay, very pale.
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
    My uncle?
    Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;  
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
  Ghost. Mark me.
    Who is't that can inform me?
    If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    That, if again this apparition come,
  Hor. Have after. To what issue wail this come?
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    But come!
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.
    Speak to me.  
    Of his affection to me.
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'  
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    To those of mine!
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
    Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    The bell then beating one-
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone  
    To you alone.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
  Ham. From top to toe?
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    To business with the King, more than the scope
by William Shakespeare
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
    But to my mind, though I am native here  
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  Hor. 'Tis here!
    That youth and observation copied there,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
  Ham. I would I had been there.
    What, is Horatio there ?
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
  Ber. Who's there.?
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    As if it some impartment did desire
    For every man hath business and desire,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    It is most retrograde to our desire;
    Before You visit him, to make inquire
    No more.
  Laer. Think it no more.
SCENE.- Elsinore.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Have you so slander any moment leisure
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
    As of a father; for let the world take note
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
    Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Give it an understanding but no tongue.
    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
    This above all- to thine own self be true,
  Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;  
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
    By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
  Rey. My lord, I have.
    But he's an arrant knave.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
  Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
  Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    And with no less nobility of love
  Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.  
    Given private time to you, and you yourself
    Being a thing immortal as itself?  
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    Must render up myself.
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
    Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
    Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
    What company, at what expense; and finding
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing  
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Ber. Long live the King!
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
  Hamlet, son to the former, and nephew to the present king.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.  
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
  Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
    Therefore I have entreated him along,  
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  
    Believe so much in him, that he is young,
    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    That swift as quicksilverr it courses through
    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    Is by a forged process of my death
    And hears it roar beneath.
    Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
  Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
  Hor. In faith,
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    What is between you? Give me up the truth.
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
  Pol. With what, i' th' name of God I
Act II. Scene I.
ACT I. Scene I.
Scene II.
Scene III.
  Hor. That can I.
    My lord, not I.
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
  Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
    O, speak!
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Claudius, King of Denmark.
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
    But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
  Ber. Last night of all,
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
  Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
  Pol. Farewell!
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.

  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
  A Priest.
    Give me one poor request.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
                         Enter Ghost.
                        Enter Ghost.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
                                                     Exit Ghost.
                                                     Exit Ghost.
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,  
  Ham. My fate cries out
    By indirections find directions out.
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
  Hor. Not when I saw't.
    Who hath reliev'd you?
  Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    Mark you,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    And that in way of caution- I must tell you
    But let me hear from you.
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
    What I have said to you.
  Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    This marvel to you.
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    I'll visit you.
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
Scene V.
Scene IV.
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
  Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
    But I have that within which passeth show-
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
  Ham. What hour now?
    See you now-
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,  
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
    I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
    For they are actions that a man might play;
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    Look you, I'll go pray.
  Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?
  Ber. Say-
    Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,  
  Fortinbras, Prince of Norway.  
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
    That he is open to incontinency.
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
  Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    All my smooth body.
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    With which she followed my poor father's body
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
  King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
  Hor. Most constantly.
    That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    That are so fortified against our story,
  Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
    Of man and country-
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    Passing through nature to eternity.  
    To his unmast'red importunity.
    As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
    To youth and liberty.
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
  Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.

Scene I. Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.  Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].    Ber. Who's there.?   Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.   Ber. Long live the King!   Fran. Bernardo?   Ber. He.   Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.   Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.   Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,     And I am sick at heart.   Ber. Have you had quiet guard?   Fran. Not a mouse stirring.   Ber. Well, good night.     If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,     The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.                      Enter Horatio and Marcellus.      Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?   Hor. Friends to this ground.   Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.   Fran. Give you good night.   Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.     Who hath reliev'd you?   Fran. Bernardo hath my place.     Give you good night.                                   Exit.   Mar. Holla, Bernardo!   Ber. Say-     What, is Horatio there ?   Hor. A piece of him.   Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.   Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?   Ber. I have seen nothing.   Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,     And will not let belief take hold of him     Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.     Therefore I have entreated him along,       With us to watch the minutes of this night,     That, if again this apparition come,     He may approve our eyes and speak to it.   Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.   Ber. Sit down awhile,     And let us once again assail your ears,     That are so fortified against our story,     What we two nights have seen.   Hor. Well, sit we down,     And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.   Ber. Last night of all,     When yond same star that's westward from the pole     Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven     Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,     The bell then beating one-                          Enter Ghost.    Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!   Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.     Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.   Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.   Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.   Ber. It would be spoke to.   Mar. Question it, Horatio.   Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night     Together with that fair and warlike form     In which the majesty of buried Denmark     Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!   Mar. It is offended.   Ber. See, it stalks away!   Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!                                                      Exit Ghost.   Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.   Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.     Is not this something more than fantasy?     What think you on't?   Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe     Without the sensible and true avouch     Of mine own eyes.     Mar. Is it not like the King?   Hor. As thou art to thyself.     Such was the very armour he had on     When he th' ambitious Norway combated.     So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,     He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.     'Tis strange.   Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,     With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.   Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;     But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,     This bodes some strange eruption to our state.   Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,     Why this same strict and most observant watch     So nightly toils the subject of the land,     And why such daily cast of brazen cannon     And foreign mart for implements of war;     Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task     Does not divide the Sunday from the week.     What might be toward, that this sweaty haste       Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?     Who is't that can inform me?   Hor. That can I.     At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,     Whose image even but now appear'd to us,     Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,     Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,     Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet     (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)     Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,     Well ratified by law and heraldry,     Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands     Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;     Against the which a moiety competent     Was gaged by our king; which had return'd     To the inheritance of Fortinbras,     Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart     And carriage of the article design'd,     His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,     Of unimproved mettle hot and full,       Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,     Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,     For food and diet, to some enterprise     That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,     As it doth well appear unto our state,     But to recover of us, by strong hand     And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands     So by his father lost; and this, I take it,     Is the main motive of our preparations,     The source of this our watch, and the chief head     Of this post-haste and romage in the land.   Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.     Well may it sort that this portentous figure     Comes armed through our watch, so like the King     That was and is the question of these wars.   Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.     In the most high and palmy state of Rome,     A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,     The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead     Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;       As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,     Disasters in the sun; and the moist star     Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands     Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.     And even the like precurse of fierce events,     As harbingers preceding still the fates     And prologue to the omen coming on,     Have heaven and earth together demonstrated     Unto our climature and countrymen.                        Enter Ghost again.      But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!     I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!                                                Spreads his arms.     If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,     Speak to me.     If there be any good thing to be done,     That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,     Speak to me.       If thou art privy to thy country's fate,     Which happily foreknowing may avoid,     O, speak!     Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life     Extorted treasure in the womb of earth     (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),                                                  The cock crows.     Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!   Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?   Hor. Do, if it will not stand.   Ber. 'Tis here!   Hor. 'Tis here!   Mar. 'Tis gone!                                                      Exit Ghost.     We do it wrong, being so majestical,     To offer it the show of violence;     For it is as the air, invulnerable,     And our vain blows malicious mockery.   Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.   Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing       Upon a fearful summons. I have heard     The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,     Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat     Awake the god of day; and at his warning,     Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,     Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies     To his confine; and of the truth herein     This present object made probation.   Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.     Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes     Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,     The bird of dawning singeth all night long;     And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,     The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,     No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,     So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.   Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.     But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,     Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.     Break we our watch up; and by my advice       Let us impart what we have seen to-night     Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,     This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.     Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,     As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?     Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know     Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.     Scene II. Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.  Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,] Lords Attendant.    King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death     The memory be green, and that it us befitted     To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom     To be contracted in one brow of woe,     Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature     That we with wisest sorrow think on him     Together with remembrance of ourselves.     Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,     Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,     Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,     With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,     With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,     In equal scale weighing delight and dole,     Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd     Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone       With this affair along. For all, our thanks.     Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,     Holding a weak supposal of our worth,     Or thinking by our late dear brother's death     Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,     Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,     He hath not fail'd to pester us with message     Importing the surrender of those lands     Lost by his father, with all bands of law,     To our most valiant brother. So much for him.     Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.     Thus much the business is: we have here writ     To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,     Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears     Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress     His further gait herein, in that the levies,     The lists, and full proportions are all made     Out of his subject; and we here dispatch     You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,     For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,       Giving to you no further personal power     To business with the King, more than the scope     Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]     Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.   Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.   King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.                                  Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.     And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?     You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?     You cannot speak of reason to the Dane     And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,     That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?     The head is not more native to the heart,     The hand more instrumental to the mouth,     Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.     What wouldst thou have, Laertes?   Laer. My dread lord,     Your leave and favour to return to France;     From whence though willingly I came to Denmark     To show my duty in your coronation,       Yet now I must confess, that duty done,     My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France     And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.   King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?   Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave     By laboursome petition, and at last     Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.     I do beseech you give him leave to go.   King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,     And thy best graces spend it at thy will!     But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-   Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!   King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?   Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.   Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,     And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.     Do not for ever with thy vailed lids     Seek for thy noble father in the dust.     Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,     Passing through nature to eternity.     Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.   Queen. If it be,     Why seems it so particular with thee?   Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'     'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,     Nor customary suits of solemn black,     Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,     No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,     Nor the dejected havior of the visage,     Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,     'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,     For they are actions that a man might play;     But I have that within which passeth show-     These but the trappings and the suits of woe.   King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,     To give these mourning duties to your father;     But you must know, your father lost a father;     That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound     In filial obligation for some term     To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever       In obstinate condolement is a course     Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;     It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,     A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,     An understanding simple and unschool'd;     For what we know must be, and is as common     As any the most vulgar thing to sense,     Why should we in our peevish opposition     Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,     A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,     To reason most absurd, whose common theme     Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,     From the first corse till he that died to-day,     'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth     This unprevailing woe, and think of us     As of a father; for let the world take note     You are the most immediate to our throne,     And with no less nobility of love     Than that which dearest father bears his son     Do I impart toward you. For your intent       In going back to school in Wittenberg,     It is most retrograde to our desire;     And we beseech you, bend you to remain     Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,     Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.   Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.     I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.   Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.   King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.     Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.     This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet     Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,     No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day     But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,     And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,     Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.                                 Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.   Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,     Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!     Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd       His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!     How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable     Seem to me all the uses of this world!     Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden     That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature     Possess it merely. That it should come to this!     But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.     So excellent a king, that was to this     Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother     That he might not beteem the winds of heaven     Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!     Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him     As if increase of appetite had grown     By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-     Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-     A little month, or ere those shoes were old     With which she followed my poor father's body     Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she     (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason     Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;       My father's brother, but no more like my father     Than I to Hercules. Within a month,     Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears     Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,     She married. O, most wicked speed, to post     With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!     It is not, nor it cannot come to good.     But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!            Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.    Hor. Hail to your lordship!   Ham. I am glad to see you well.     Horatio!- or I do forget myself.   Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.   Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.     And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?     Marcellus?   Mar. My good lord!   Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-       But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?   Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.   Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,     Nor shall you do my ear that violence     To make it truster of your own report     Against yourself. I know you are no truant.     But what is your affair in Elsinore?     We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.   Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.   Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.     I think it was to see my mother's wedding.   Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.   Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats     Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.     Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven     Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!     My father- methinks I see my father.   Hor. O, where, my lord?   Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.   Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.     Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.     I shall not look upon his like again.   Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.   Ham. Saw? who?   Hor. My lord, the King your father.   Ham. The King my father?   Hor. Season your admiration for a while     With an attent ear, till I may deliver     Upon the witness of these gentlemen,     This marvel to you.   Ham. For God's love let me hear!   Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen     (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch     In the dead vast and middle of the night     Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,     Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,     Appears before them and with solemn march     Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd     By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,     Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd       Almost to jelly with the act of fear,     Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me     In dreadful secrecy impart they did,     And I with them the third night kept the watch;     Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,     Form of the thing, each word made true and good,     The apparition comes. I knew your father.     These hands are not more like.   Ham. But where was this?   Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.   Ham. Did you not speak to it?   Hor. My lord, I did;     But answer made it none. Yet once methought     It lifted up it head and did address     Itself to motion, like as it would speak;     But even then the morning cock crew loud,     And at the sound it shrunk in haste away     And vanish'd from our sight.   Ham. 'Tis very strange.   Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;       And we did think it writ down in our duty     To let you know of it.   Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.     Hold you the watch to-night?   Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.   Ham. Arm'd, say you?   Both. Arm'd, my lord.   Ham. From top to toe?   Both. My lord, from head to foot.   Ham. Then saw you not his face?   Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.   Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.   Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.   Ham. Pale or red?   Hor. Nay, very pale.   Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?   Hor. Most constantly.   Ham. I would I had been there.   Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.   Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?     Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.   Both. Longer, longer.   Hor. Not when I saw't.   Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?   Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,     A sable silver'd.   Ham. I will watch to-night.     Perchance 'twill walk again.   Hor. I warr'nt it will.   Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,     I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape     And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,     If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,     Let it be tenable in your silence still;     And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,     Give it an understanding but no tongue.     I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.     Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,     I'll visit you.   All. Our duty to your honour.     Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.                                         Exeunt [all but Hamlet].     My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.     I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!     Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,     Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes. Exit.     Scene III. Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.  Enter Laertes and Ophelia.    Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.     And, sister, as the winds give benefit     And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,     But let me hear from you.   Oph. Do you doubt that?   Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,     Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;     A violet in the youth of primy nature,     Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;     The perfume and suppliance of a minute;     No more.   Oph. No more but so?   Laer. Think it no more.     For nature crescent does not grow alone     In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,     The inward service of the mind and soul     Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,       And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch     The virtue of his will; but you must fear,     His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;     For he himself is subject to his birth.     He may not, as unvalued persons do,     Carve for himself, for on his choice depends     The safety and health of this whole state,     And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd     Unto the voice and yielding of that body     Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,     It fits your wisdom so far to believe it     As he in his particular act and place     May give his saying deed; which is no further     Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.     Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain     If with too credent ear you list his songs,     Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open     To his unmast'red importunity.     Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,     And keep you in the rear of your affection,       Out of the shot and danger of desire.     The chariest maid is prodigal enough     If she unmask her beauty to the moon.     Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.     The canker galls the infants of the spring     Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,     And in the morn and liquid dew of youth     Contagious blastments are most imminent.     Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.     Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.   Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep     As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,     Do not as some ungracious pastors do,     Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,     Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,     Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads     And recks not his own rede.   Laer. O, fear me not!                         Enter Polonius.        I stay too long. But here my father comes.     A double blessing is a double grace;     Occasion smiles upon a second leave.   Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!     The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,     And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!     And these few precepts in thy memory     Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,     Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.     Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:     Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,     Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;     But do not dull thy palm with entertainment     Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware     Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,     Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.     Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;     Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.     Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,       But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;     For the apparel oft proclaims the man,     And they in France of the best rank and station     Are most select and generous, chief in that.     Neither a borrower nor a lender be;     For loan oft loses both itself and friend,     And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.     This above all- to thine own self be true,     And it must follow, as the night the day,     Thou canst not then be false to any man.     Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!   Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.   Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.   Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well     What I have said to you.   Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,     And you yourself shall keep the key of it.   Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.   Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?   Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.     Pol. Marry, well bethought!     'Tis told me he hath very oft of late     Given private time to you, and you yourself     Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.     If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,     And that in way of caution- I must tell you     You do not understand yourself so clearly     As it behooves my daughter and your honour.     What is between you? Give me up the truth.   Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders     Of his affection to me.   Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,     Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.     Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?   Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,   Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby     That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,     Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,     Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,     Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.     Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love     In honourable fashion.   Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!   Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,     With almost all the holy vows of heaven.   Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,     When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul     Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,     Giving more light than heat, extinct in both     Even in their promise, as it is a-making,     You must not take for fire. From this time     Be something scanter of your maiden presence.     Set your entreatments at a higher rate     Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,     Believe so much in him, that he is young,     And with a larger tether may he walk     Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,     Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,     Not of that dye which their investments show,     But mere implorators of unholy suits,       Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,     The better to beguile. This is for all:     I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth     Have you so slander any moment leisure     As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.     Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.   Oph. I shall obey, my lord.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene IV. Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.  Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.    Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.   Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.   Ham. What hour now?   Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.   Mar. No, it is struck.   Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season     Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.                    A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.     What does this mean, my lord?   Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,     Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,     And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,     The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out     The triumph of his pledge.   Hor. Is it a custom?   Ham. Ay, marry, is't;     But to my mind, though I am native here       And to the manner born, it is a custom     More honour'd in the breach than the observance.     This heavy-headed revel east and west     Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;     They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase     Soil our addition; and indeed it takes     From our achievements, though perform'd at height,     The pith and marrow of our attribute.     So oft it chances in particular men     That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,     As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,     Since nature cannot choose his origin,-     By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,     Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,     Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens     The form of plausive manners, that these men     Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,     Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,     Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,     As infinite as man may undergo-       Shall in the general censure take corruption     From that particular fault. The dram of e'il     Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.                           Enter Ghost.    Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!   Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!     Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,     Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,     Be thy intents wicked or charitable,     Thou com'st in such a questionable shape     That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,     King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?     Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell     Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,     Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre     Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,     Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws     To cast thee up again. What may this mean       That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,     Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,     Making night hideous, and we fools of nature     So horridly to shake our disposition     With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?     Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?                                            Ghost beckons Hamlet.   Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,     As if it some impartment did desire     To you alone.   Mar. Look with what courteous action     It waves you to a more removed ground.     But do not go with it!   Hor. No, by no means!   Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.   Hor. Do not, my lord!   Ham. Why, what should be the fear?     I do not set my life at a pin's fee;     And for my soul, what can it do to that,     Being a thing immortal as itself?       It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.   Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,     Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff     That beetles o'er his base into the sea,     And there assume some other, horrible form     Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason     And draw you into madness? Think of it.     The very place puts toys of desperation,     Without more motive, into every brain     That looks so many fadoms to the sea     And hears it roar beneath.   Ham. It waves me still.     Go on. I'll follow thee.   Mar. You shall not go, my lord.   Ham. Hold off your hands!   Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.   Ham. My fate cries out     And makes each petty artire in this body     As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.                                                 [Ghost beckons.]       Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.     By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-     I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.                                         Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.   Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.   Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.   Hor. Have after. To what issue wail this come?   Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.   Hor. Heaven will direct it.   Mar. Nay, let's follow him.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene V. Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.  Enter Ghost and Hamlet.    Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.   Ghost. Mark me.   Ham. I will.   Ghost. My hour is almost come,     When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames     Must render up myself.   Ham. Alas, poor ghost!   Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing     To what I shall unfold.   Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.   Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.   Ham. What?   Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,     Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,     And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,     Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature     Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid       To tell the secrets of my prison house,     I could a tale unfold whose lightest word     Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,     Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,     Thy knotted and combined locks to part,     And each particular hair to stand an end     Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.     But this eternal blazon must not be     To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!     If thou didst ever thy dear father love-   Ham. O God!   Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.   Ham. Murther?   Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;     But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.   Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift     As meditation or the thoughts of love,     May sweep to my revenge.   Ghost. I find thee apt;     And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed       That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,     Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.     'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,     A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark     Is by a forged process of my death     Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,     The serpent that did sting thy father's life     Now wears his crown.   Ham. O my prophetic soul!     My uncle?   Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,     With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-     O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power     So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust     The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.     O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,     From me, whose love was of that dignity     That it went hand in hand even with the vow     I made to her in marriage, and to decline     Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor       To those of mine!     But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,     Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,     So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,     Will sate itself in a celestial bed     And prey on garbage.     But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.     Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,     My custom always of the afternoon,     Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,     With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,     And in the porches of my ears did pour     The leperous distilment; whose effect     Holds such an enmity with blood of man     That swift as quicksilverr it courses through     The natural gates and alleys of the body,     And with a sudden vigour it doth posset     And curd, like eager droppings into milk,     The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;     And a most instant tetter bark'd about,       Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust     All my smooth body.     Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand     Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;     Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,     Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,     No reckoning made, but sent to my account     With all my imperfections on my head.   Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!   Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.     Let not the royal bed of Denmark be     A couch for luxury and damned incest.     But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,     Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive     Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,     And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge     To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.     The glowworm shows the matin to be near     And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.     Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.     Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?     And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!     And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,     But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?     Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat     In this distracted globe. Remember thee?     Yea, from the table of my memory     I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,     All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past     That youth and observation copied there,     And thy commandment all alone shall live     Within the book and volume of my brain,     Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!     O most pernicious woman!     O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!     My tables! Meet it is I set it down     That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;     At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]     So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:     It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'       I have sworn't.   Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!                     Enter Horatio and Marcellus.    Mar. Lord Hamlet!   Hor.

O, wonderful!   Hor. Good my lord, tell it.   Ham. No, you will reveal it.   Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!   Mar. Nor I, my lord.   Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?     But you'll be secret?   Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.     Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark     But he's an arrant knave.   Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave     To tell us this.   Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!     And so, without more circumstance at all,     I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;     You, as your business and desires shall point you,     For every man hath business and desire,     Such as it is; and for my own poor part,     Look you, I'll go pray.   Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.   Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;     Yes, faith, heartily.   Hor. There's no offence, my lord.   Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,     And much offence too. Touching this vision here,     It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.     For your desire to know what is between us,     O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,       As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,     Give me one poor request.   Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.   Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.   Both. My lord, we will not.   Ham. Nay, but swear't.   Hor. In faith,     My lord, not I.   Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.   Ham. Upon my sword.   Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.   Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.                   Ghost cries under the stage.    Ghost. Swear.   Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?     Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.     Consent to swear.   Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.     Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.     Swear by my sword.   Ghost. [beneath] Swear.   Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.     Come hither, gentlemen,     And lay your hands again upon my sword.     Never to speak of this that you have heard:     Swear by my sword.   Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.   Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?     A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."   Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!   Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.     There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,     Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.     But come!     Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,     How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself     (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet     To put an antic disposition on),       That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,     With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,     Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,     As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'     Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'     Or such ambiguous giving out, to note     That you know aught of me- this is not to do,     So grace and mercy at your most need help you,     Swear.   Ghost. [beneath] Swear.                                                    [They swear.]   Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,     With all my love I do commend me to you;     And what so poor a man as Hamlet is     May do t' express his love and friending to you,     God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;     And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.     The time is out of joint. O cursed spite     That ever I was born to set it right!     Nay, come, let's go together.                                                            Exeunt.     Act II. Scene I. Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.  Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.    Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.   Rey. I will, my lord.   Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,     Before You visit him, to make inquire     Of his behaviour.   Rey. My lord, I did intend it.   Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,     Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;     And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,     What company, at what expense; and finding     By this encompassment and drift of question     That they do know my son, come you more nearer     Than your particular demands will touch it.     Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;     As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,     And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?   Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.     Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.     But if't be he I mean, he's very wild     Addicted so and so'; and there put on him     What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank     As may dishonour him- take heed of that;     But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips     As are companions noted and most known     To youth and liberty.   Rey. As gaming, my lord.   Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,     Drabbing. You may go so far.   Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.   Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.     You must not put another scandal on him,     That he is open to incontinency.     That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly     That they may seem the taints of liberty,     The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,     A savageness in unreclaimed blood,     Of general assault.     Rey. But, my good lord-   Pol. Wherefore should you do this?   Rey. Ay, my lord,     I would know that.   Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,     And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.     You laying these slight sullies on my son     As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,     Mark you,     Your party in converse, him you would sound,     Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes     The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd     He closes with you in this consequence:     'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-     According to the phrase or the addition     Of man and country-   Rey. Very good, my lord.   Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?     By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?   Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and       gentleman.'   Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!     He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.     I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,     Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,     There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;     There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,     'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'     Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.     See you now-     Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;     And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,     With windlasses and with assays of bias,     By indirections find directions out.     So, by my former lecture and advice,     Shall you my son. You have me, have you not   Rey. My lord, I have.   Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!   Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]   Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.     Rey. I shall, my lord.   Pol. And let him ply his music.   Rey. Well, my lord.   Pol. Farewell!                                                   Exit Reynaldo.                         Enter Ophelia.      How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?   Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!   Pol. With what, i' th' name of God I   Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,     Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,     No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,     Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;     Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,     And with a look so piteous in purport     As if he had been loosed out of hell     To speak of horrors- he comes before me.   Pol. Mad for thy love?
